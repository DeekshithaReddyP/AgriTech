## Introduction

Frame differencing involves comparing consecutive frames in a video stream to detect changes or motion. It works by calculating the pixel-wise difference between frames, identifying regions where significant changes have occurred. Below, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this technique.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:

- **Motion Detection:** Frame differencing effectively detects moving objects or changes in a video stream.
- **Real-time Processing:** Suitable for real-time or near-real-time applications.
- **Simple Implementation:** Easy to implement in software or hardware.
- **Low Computational Cost:** Requires minimal computational resources compared to complex object detection methods.

### Disadvantages:

- **Sensitivity to Noise:** Can produce false positives due to noise or minor lighting variations.
- **Static Background Assumption:** Assumes a relatively static background.
- **Object Size and Speed:** May not handle objects of varying sizes or different speeds well.
- **Ghosting and Flickering:** Can produce ghosting effects or flickering artifacts.
- **Initialization:** Requires an initial frame as a reference, missing any motion before this frame is established.

## Steps for Implementation

1. **Capture Video Frames:** Obtain consecutive frames from a video stream using a camera or video file.

2. **Convert to Grayscale:** Simplify processing by converting each frame to grayscale.

3. **Frame Differencing:** Calculate the absolute pixel-wise difference between consecutive frames.

4. **Thresholding:** Apply a threshold to identify significant changes. Pixels exceeding a certain threshold belong to the moving foreground.

5. **Filtering and Post-processing:** Use morphological operations to remove noise and smooth detected regions.

6. **Object Detection/Tracking:** Optionally, use connected component analysis or tracking algorithms to identify and track objects in the foreground.

7. **Visualize/Act on Detected Motion:** Depending on your application, visualize the detected motion or trigger relevant actions.

8. **Update Reference Frame:** Periodically update the reference frame to adapt to background changes or reset it when needed.
